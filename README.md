# Description
Python script to execute pastebin and pastebin like code on Piston using 
the new httpx python request library (Just to be different).

NB: use the raw link for python as code or any other code where formatting blocks matters!

If you find this useful, give us a star. Feel free to contribute, I created this to be
a community type project!
